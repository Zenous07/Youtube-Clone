# 📺 YouTube Clone (Structure & Styling)

Hello, Coders! 👋  
This is a **YouTube-inspired** project where I replicated the **structure and styling** of YouTube using only **HTML and CSS**.  
It’s not a fully functional clone, but rather a **UI recreation** to practice layout design, responsiveness, and styling.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **YouTube-like Layout** – Header, sidebar, and video grid designed to resemble YouTube.
- 🔗 **Redirects to Real YouTube** – Clicking a video opens the actual YouTube video via `<a>` tags.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.
- 🏗️ **Pure HTML & CSS** – No JavaScript, just structure and styling.

## 📌 About the Project
This was one of my **first-year college projects**, even though I had done some smaller projects in 12th grade.  
It was mainly built to **strengthen my HTML & CSS skills** and understand **responsive layouts**.  
I added simple link redirects to make it *feel* like videos were playing.
